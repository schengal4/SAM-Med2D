    1. **Image Input:**
        - You can either: 
            * **Upload an image** directly from your device. Accepted formats are ".jpg", ".jpeg", or ".png".
            * Or **type in the image URL**. If using Google Search, right-click on the image and select "Copy Image Address" to obtain the URL.

    # Instructions for model selection

    2. **Model Selection:**
       - You'll have the option to select between two SAM-Med2D models: `SAM-Med2D-B_w/o_adapter` and `SAM-Med2D-B`. Make your choice from the dropdown menu. \
        The 'SAM-Med2D-B_w/o_adapter' model slightly outperforms the other according to testing done by the model makers.

    3. **Segmentation Mode**
        - **Bounding Box Mode**: Draw rectangles around the area you wish to segment.
            - Once you've drawn the desired bounding boxes, press 'Run SAM-Med2D model'.
        - **Multi-point Interaction Mode**: Mark specific points on the image.
            * Foreground Points (Green): Indicate areas of interest. For instance, potential lesions in an MRI scan.
            * Background Points (Red): Specify areas you're not interested in, helping the model differentiate.
            * After marking the points, click 'Run SAM-Med2D model'.

    5. **Initiating the Segmentation Process:**
       - After marking your points, click the "Run SAM-Med2D model" button.
       - Please be patient, as the algorithm processes the image. An info message will appear indicating that the model is running.
       - If you haven't selected a foreground point or drawn a bounding box (depending on the mode), you'll be prompted to do so before the model can proceed.

    6. **Viewing & Downloading the Results:**
       - Once segmentation is complete, the segmented image will be displayed under the subheader "Image with the Indicated Region Segmented."
       - To download the segmented image, click the "Download image" button.
       - To download the masks alone without the underlying image, click the "Download masks without underlying image" button.

    - For the **Multi-point Interaction** mode, just a few well-placed points can often provide the clarity the model needs.
    - For the **Bounding Box** mode, ensure the boxes encapsulate the entirety of the region you're interested in.
